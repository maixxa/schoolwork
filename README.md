This program is supposed to be able to read/write and append vehicle and obstacle data to two separate text files as well as calculate a crash test using said vehicle and obstacle data.

At the moment i have been unable to get past the reading and writing of the text files without the program window closing on me which is why many of the other functions have not even been attempted yet. The program looks messy as i have re-written parts multiple times as i find different answers to how to write the code yet did not work.

I have done my coding in quincy 2005.
The data in the vehicle textfile data is placeholder so the car information is likely wrong.
